    <p>
      I'm originally from the Philippines and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from AMA Computer College-Cebu Campus.

      I arrived on the island in August 2023 to pursue a Postgraduate Certificate in Digital Design and Development.
      
      Outside of my academic commitments, I find joy in reading and contributing to the community. Currently, I'm immersed in Mary Oliver's poetry collection, "When I Awake," along with "Circe" and "Atomic Habits." Additionally, I've had the honor of actively participating as a volunteer in the Christ the King Sunday afternoon choir.
